# Hand_Writting_Classifier
A handwriting classifier is a type of machine learning model trained to recognize and classify handwritten characters or symbols. It takes an image of handwritten text as input and predicts which character or symbol it represents. 

To develop a handwriting classifier, a dataset of handwritten samples is collected and labeled with the corresponding characters. This dataset is then used to train a machine learning model, typically using algorithms like convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or support vector machines (SVMs). During training, the model learns to extract features from the images that are characteristic of each handwritten character.

Once trained, the classifier can accurately recognize and classify handwritten characters in new, unseen images. This technology is widely used in applications such as optical character recognition (OCR), digit recognition for postal services, and automated form processing.

Overall, handwriting classifiers play a crucial role in automating tasks that involve handwritten text, saving time and effort compared to manual transcription.
